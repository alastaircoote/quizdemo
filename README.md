Quiz Demo
=========

This is a very simple, mocked up demo of a quiz webapp. Heavy use of require.js, Backbone.js, Underscore.js templating, LESS.css, the Facebook Graph API and the YouTube API for a little fun. Playable here:

After you've logged in, click anywhere in the main box to start the quiz. None of the code is optimized (require.js not optimised, CSS not compressed) for better code viewability when using it.
